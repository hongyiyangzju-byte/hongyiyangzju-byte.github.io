I am a junior undergraduate student at **Zhejiang University**, majoring in **Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering**. I am a member of the *Chu Kochen Honors College (Mixed Class)*, an elite program for the top 5% of students.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Quantum Nanophotonics** and **Computational Physics**. I am particularly interested in developing novel quantum light sources and exploring electron transport properties in low-dimensional materials using methods like NEGF and DFT.

I am currently looking for PhD opportunities starting in **Fall 2027**.
